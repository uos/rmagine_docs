# Rmagine

Rmagine allows a robot to simulate sensor data for arbitrary range sensors directly on board via raytracing. Since robots typically only have limited computational resources, Rmagine aims at being flexible and lightweight, while scaling well even to large environment maps. It runs on several platforms like Laptops or embedded computing boards like Nvidia Jetson by putting an unified API over specific proprietary libraries provided by the hardware manufacturers. This work is designed to support the future development of robotic applications depending on simulation of range data that could previously not be computed in reasonable time on mobile systems.
