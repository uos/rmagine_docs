# Rmagine

[Rmagine](https://github.com/uos/rmagine) allows a robot to simulate sensor data for arbitrary range sensors directly on board via raytracing. Since robots typically only have limited computational resources, [Rmagine](https://github.com/uos/rmagine) aims at being flexible and lightweight, while scaling well even to large environment maps. It runs on several platforms like Laptops or embedded computing boards like Nvidia Jetson by putting an unified API over specific proprietary libraries provided by the hardware manufacturers. This work is designed to support the future development of robotic applications depending on simulation of range data that could previously not be computed in reasonable time on mobile systems.

## Design Goals

[Rmagine](https://github.com/uos/rmagine) is mainly designed for robotic applications:

- Perform multiple sensor simulations simultaneously and in realtime.
- Compute the same operations on different computing devices (CPU, GPU..).
- Hold data at device of computation to minimize copy overhead between devices.
- Maintain minimal graphical overhead (offscreen-rendering)
- Support runtime critical operations, e.g. Monte Carlo simulations

## Intersection Attributes

Rmagine supports to select certain attributes that shall be computed and returned at a ray-surface intersection.
The following image shows the simulating a spherical sensor model and selecting Cartesian points (`rm::Points`), surface normals (`rm::Normals`), object ids (`rm::ObjectIds`) as attributes.

The points and normals are represented by a fixed length line segment with the Cartesian point as origin the surface normal as direction, colored by the object id.
