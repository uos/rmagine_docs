# Rmagine
## 3D Range Sensor Simulation in Polygonal Maps via Ray Tracing for Embedded Hardware on Mobile Robots

Library for fast sensor data simulation in large 3D environments.

## Design Goals

Mainly designed for robotic applications:

- Perform multiple sensor simulations simultaneously and in realtime
- Perform computations at specific computing devices (CPU, GPU..)
- Hold data at device of computation
- Minimal graphical overhead (offscreen-rendering)
- Runtime critical operations

## Publications

In addition to the wiki, the following papers wrap up the library conceptually. Please reference the following papers when using the Rmagine library in your scientific work.
